**📦 Type:** Personal Project  
**🎯 Role:**  Mobile Engineer  
**🧠 Stack:** Kotlin (Android), Retrofit, WalletConnect, Umi Network, Firebase

## 📱 What I Built

Etibe is a decentralized Ajo/Esusu system that allows users to:

- Create or join monthly group saving channels
- Set contribution amount, start date, grace period, and payout order
- Make and track onchain contributions in USDC (on Umi Network)
- Receive payouts when it's their turn — with automated order logic

I handled:

- Full Android frontend
- REST API integration
- WalletConnect auth
- Onchain transaction submission and feedback UI

---

## 💡 Highlights

- Built **modal bottom sheets** to show contribution confirmations and copyable transaction hashes.
- Used **Kotlin coroutines** for all wallet transactions and image uploads (fixed ANRs).
- Allowed toggling between public/private group discovery.
- Designed intuitive Create Etibe flow, with custom payout logic per member.

## 🔧 Key Features

- Dynamic payout order (e.g., 0xA gets paid in month 1, 0xB in month 2)
- Invite-only or public Etibes
- Channel dashboard showing size, balance, contribution, and status

---

## 🧠 Future Plans

- Onchain dispute resolution
- Staking or reputation for group organizers
- Gas fee optimizations for recurring contributors

## 🔐 Code is Private

Etibe is in development and will open source post audit.
